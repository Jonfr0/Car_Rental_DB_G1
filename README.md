## Project Overview
 
The **Car Rental Management System** is a database project created for the **CIS 440 Database Systems** course at **Minnesota State University, Mankato**.  

Our group built this system to handle key operations for a car rental business, including **reservations**, **vehicle tracking**, **rentals**, and **payments**.
 
We designed the full **database structure**, applied **normalization (1NF–BCNF)** to organize data efficiently, and implemented several advanced SQL features like **joins**, **stored procedures**, **triggers**, and **CTEs** to improve functionality.  
 
The system also connects to a **PHP web application** backed by a **MySQL database**, allowing real-time updates on **rental revenue**, **vehicle availability**, and **customer activity**.  

Overall, this project demonstrates how database design and web integration can work together to create a smooth, real-world car rental management experience.
